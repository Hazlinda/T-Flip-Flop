# T-Flip-Flop
The clock has to be high for the inputs to get active. Thus, T flip-flop is a controlled Bi-stable latch where the clock signal is the control signal. Thus, the output has two stable states based on the inputs which have been discussed below. The T flip flop is the modified form of JK flip flop.
